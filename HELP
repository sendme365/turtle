##FAQ
- How do I change the default terminal window size?
- Edit the CONFIG file in the turtle directory in order to change this.
- Why aren't all environment files included in a Turtle generated hosts file?
- Not all environments are live or have a specific purpose within hybris Cloud Services. These are therefore omitted from the generated hosts file. If an error is found with this process please report it to Tom Kendall.
